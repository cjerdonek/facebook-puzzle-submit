This project contains a user-friendly Python script for submitting puzzle
solutions to the Facebook PuzzleBot, per this web page:

http://www.facebook.com/careers/puzzles.php

Features of the script include--

* CC'ing puzzle submissions to the sender
* a "test mode" for sending submissions to a test e-mail address
* tarring and gzipping a directory
* automatic puzzle name detection and validation
* allowing the inclusion of a descriptive note in the e-mail body

This script is especially useful for submitting solutions from a gmail
account, as the Facebook PuzzleBot is/was unable to read e-mail attachments
attached using gmail's GUI.  The script author has only tried this script
using gmail's SMTP servers at smtp.gmail.com.

For help documentation, execute this script with the -h or --help option.
