This project contains a Python script for submitting puzzle solutions to
the Facebook PuzzleBot, per this web page:

http://www.facebook.com/careers/puzzles.php

This script is especially useful for submitting solutions from a gmail
account, as the Facebook PuzzleBot is/was unable to read e-mail attachments
attached using gmail's GUI.  The script author has only tried this script
using gmail's SMTP servers at smtp.gmail.com.

Setup:

You will need to set the SENDER_ADDRESS and TEST_SUBMISSION_ADDRESS
constants inside the script before using it.

For usage instructions, execute this script with the -h or --help option.
